# Part 1 Background
Our users have points in their accounts. Users only see a single balance in their account, but for reporting purposes, we track their points per payer. A payer is the producer of the item that points were added through. For example, a person who redeems yogurt may have points added through the payer DANNON. We track the payer from whom points are added, as well as when the points were added, so we know which payer to bill when the user spends their points on a reward.
